# MyChatApp

This project is a chat application that I made as a final project in the class DB Programming. In this application I have a basic login/register form. After you have logged in you are directed to the chat application, I have it so every new message is displayed to all users along with who sent it and the time it was sent. To add to this I have an Online/Offline function to display whether the user is on. Although this was all built on my localdb, I didn't have a clouddb that I could use. So the only person you will be chatting with is yourself sadly.
